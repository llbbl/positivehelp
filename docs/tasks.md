# React Component Unit Testing Tasks

This document outlines the tasks required to add unit testing to all React components in the project. The testing will use Jest and React Testing Library, which are already set up in the project.

## Main Components

### RuntimeLogger Component
- [ ] Create test file: `__tests__/components/RuntimeLogger.test.tsx`

## Testing Guidelines

1. **Mock External Dependencies**: Use Jest's mocking capabilities to mock external dependencies like fetch, Next.js components, etc.

2. **Test Component Behavior**: Focus on testing component behavior rather than implementation details.

3. **Test Edge Cases**: Include tests for edge cases like empty states, error states, etc.

4. **Follow Existing Patterns**: Follow the patterns established in the existing tests for consistency.

5. **Use Testing Library Best Practices**: Use Testing Library's queries in this order of preference:
   - Queries accessible to everyone (getByRole, getByLabelText, getByPlaceholderText, getByText)
   - Semantic queries (getByAltText, getByTitle)
   - Test IDs as a last resort (getByTestId)

6. **Test Accessibility**: Include tests for accessibility where applicable.

7. **Keep Tests Focused**: Each test should focus on testing one specific aspect of the component.

8. **Use Descriptive Test Names**: Use descriptive test names that clearly indicate what is being tested.
